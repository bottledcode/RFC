## Introduction

In modern PHP development, the need for concise and immutable data
structures is increasingly recognized. Inspired by the concept of
"records", "data objects", or "structs" in other languages, this RFC
proposes the addition of `record` objects in PHP. These records will
provide a concise and immutable data structure, distinct from `readonly`
classes, enabling developers to define immutable objects with less
boilerplate code.

## Proposal

This RFC proposes the introduction of a new record keyword in PHP to
define immutable data objects. These objects will allow properties to be
initialized concisely and will provide built-in methods for common
operations such as modifying properties and equality checks using a
function-like instantiation syntax. Records can implement interfaces and
use traits but cannot extend other records or classes.

#### Syntax and semantics

##### Definition

A `record` is defined by the word "record", followed by the name of its
type, an open parenthesis containing zero or more typed parameters that
become public, immutable, properties. They may optionally implement an
interface using the `implements` keyword. A `record` body is optional.

A `record` may NOT contain a constructor; instead of defining initial
values, property hooks should be used to produce computable values
on-demand. Defining a constructor emits a compilation error.

A `record` body may contain property hooks, methods, and use traits.
Regular properties may also be defined, but they are immutable by
default and are no different than `const`.

Static properties and methods are forbidden in a `record` (this includes
`const`, a regular property may be used instead). Attempting to define
static properties, methods, constants results in a compilation error.

``` php
namespace Geometry;

interface Shape {
  public function area(): float;
}

trait Dimension {
  public function dimensions(): array {
    return [$this->width, $this->height];
  }
}

record Vector2(int $x, int $y);

record Rectangle(Vector2 $leftTop, Vector2 $rightBottom) implements Shape {
  use Dimension;

  public int $height = 1; // this will always and forever be "1", it is immutable.

  public int $width { get => $this->rightBottom->x - $this->topLeft->x; }
  public int $height { get => $this->rightBottom->y - $this->topLeft->y; }

  public function area(): float {
    return $this->width * $this->height;
  }
}
```

##### Usage

A `record` may be used as a `readonly class`, as the behavior of it is
very similar with no key differences to assist in migration from
`readonly class`.

``` php
$rect1 = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), Point(1, -1));
$rect2 = $rect1->with(topLeft: Point(0, 1));

var_dump($rect2->dimensions());
```

##### Optional parameters and default values

A `record` can also be defined with optional parameters that are set if
left out during instantiation.

``` php
record Rectangle(int $x, int $y = 10);
var_dump(Rectangle(10)); // output a record with x: 10 and y: 10
```

##### Auto-generated `with` method

To enhance the usability of records, the RFC proposes automatically
generating a `with` method for each record. This method allows for
partial updates of properties, creating a new instance of the record
with the specified properties updated.

The auto-generated `with` method accepts only named arguments defined in
the constructor. No other property names can be used, and it returns a
new record object with the given values.

``` php
$point1 = Point(3, 4);
$point2 = $point1->with(x: 5);
$point3 = $point1->with(null, 10); // must use named arguments

echo $point1->x; // Outputs: 3
echo $point2->x; // Outputs: 5
```

A developer may define their own `with` method if they so choose.

#### Performance considerations

To ensure that records are both performant and memory-efficient, the RFC
proposes leveraging PHP's copy-on-write (COW) semantics (similar to
arrays) and interning values. Unlike interned strings, the garbage
collector will be allowed to clean up these interned records when they
are no longer needed.

``` php
$point1 = Point(3, 4);
$point2 = $point1; // No data duplication, $point2 references the same data as $point1
$point3 = Point(3, 4); // No data duplication here either, it is pointing the the same memory as $point1

$point4 = $point1->with(x: 5); // Data duplication occurs here, creating a new instance with modified data
```

##### Cloning and with()

Calling `clone` on a `record` results in the exact same record object
being returned. As it is a "value" object, it represents a value and is
the same thing as saying `clone 3`â€”you expect to get back a `3`.

`with` may be called with no arguments, and it is the same behavior as
`clone`. This is an important consideration because a developer may call
`$new = $record->with(...$array)` and we don't want to crash. If a
developer wants to crash, they can do by `assert($new !== $record)`.

#### Equality

A `record` is always strongly equal (`===`) to another record with the
same value in the properties, much like an `array` is strongly equal to
another array containing the same elements. For all intents,
`$recordA === $recordB` is the same as `$recordA == $recordB`.

Comparison operations will behave exactly like they do for classes.

### Reflection

Records in PHP will be fully supported by the reflection API, providing
access to their properties and methods just like regular classes.
However, immutability and special instantiation rules will be enforced.

#### ReflectionClass support

`ReflectionClass` can be used to inspect records, their properties, and
methods. Any attempt to modify record properties via reflection will
throw an exception, maintaining immutability. Attempting to create a new
instance via `ReflectionClass` will cause a `ReflectionException` to be
thrown.

``` php
$point = Point(3, 4);
$reflection = new \ReflectionClass($point);

foreach ($reflection->getProperties() as $property) {
    echo $property->getName() . ': ' . $property->getValue($point) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

#### Immutability enforcement

Attempts to modify record properties via reflection will throw an
exception.

``` php
try {
    $property = $reflection->getProperty('x');
    $property->setValue($point, 10); // This will throw an exception
} catch (\ReflectionException $e) {
    echo 'Exception: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL; // "Cannot modify a record property"
}
```

#### ReflectionFunction for implicit constructor

Using `ReflectionFunction` on a record will reflect the implicit
constructor.

``` php
$constructor = new \ReflectionFunction('Geometry\Point');
echo 'Constructor Parameters: ';
foreach ($constructor->getParameters() as $param) {
    echo $param->getName() . ' ';
}
```

#### New functions and methods

- Calling `is_object($record)` will return `true`.
- A new function, `is_record($record)`, will return `true` for records,
  and `false` otherwise
- Calling `get_class($record)` will return the record name

#### var_dump

Calling `var_dump` will look much like it does for objects, but instead
of `object` it will say `record`.

    record(Point)#1 (2) {
      ["x"]=>
      int(1)
      ["y"]=>
      int(2)
    }

### Considerations for implementations

A `record` cannot be named after an existing `record`, `class` or
`function`. This is because defining a `record` creates both a `class`
and a `function` with the same name.

### Auto loading

As invoking a record value by its name looks remarkably similar to
calling a function, and PHP has no function autoloader, auto loading
will not be supported in this implementation. If function auto loading
were to be implemented in the future, an autoloader could locate the
`record` and autoload it. The author of this RFC strongly encourages
someone to put forward a function auto loading RFC if auto loading is
desired for records.
